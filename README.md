## Description

This repository contains the generated instances themselves, together with the visual representation of the obtained solutions and their corresponding objective values.

### Repository Structure

- **`input/`**  
  Includes the generated input instances in **JSON** format, organized into separate instance families.  
  Each family is structured into two subdirectories:
  - **`targets/`** — contains the spatial coordinates of the targets along with their respective processing times.  
  - **`instances/`** — contains the additional input parameters associated with each target and scenario configuration.

- **`output/`**  
  Stores the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm, including their objective values and, when applicable, their graphical representations.
