## Description

This repository provides the software tool used for generating the families of benchmark instances employed in the experimental evaluation of the algorithm proposed in the aforementioned paper.  
It also contains the generated instances themselves, together with the visual representation of the obtained solutions and their corresponding objective values.

### Repository Structure

- **`build/`** and **`generator/`**  
  Contain the source code and compiled tools responsible for generating the benchmark instances.

- **`input/`**  
  Includes the generated input instances in **JSON** format, organized into separate instance families.  
  Each family is structured into two subdirectories:
  - **`targets/`** — contains the spatial coordinates of the targets along with their respective processing times.  
  - **`instances/`** — contains the additional input parameters associated with each target and scenario configuration.

- **`output/`**  
  Stores the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm, including their objective values and, when applicable, their graphical representations.
